# Overview

This program is a simple painting app for Android written in Kotlin. It has a brush and eraser functionality.

The purpose of the project was to become familiar with making a paint app in Kotlin. I've made paint apps in Java, but Kotlin is more optimal for Android. I want to eventually make and release a p    rofessional level art app that is free and has no ads. There are not many good options for Android, as they either cost money, lock basic features behind a premium subscription, or stuffed with ads. This app is very far from that point, but it is a start.
